 // Exercise or Lab name Random Dad Jokes

 // Brief Description of what you did. created a webpage that pulls from an api to display a random dad joke at the click of a button

 // You can add multiple dates with description.

// Peer Review (Brandon Estrada) - Your project works well, I could not get it to break. The event listener and JavaScript all function properly and a new dad joke is shown everytime you click the button. I like the gif you chose for your project, and the color scheme to match it.
